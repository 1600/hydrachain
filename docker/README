Running a local network with docker
===================================

Prerequisites
-------------

- docker-compose


Note: The following commands all have to be run from within the
docker/dev/hydrachain directory


Building the containers
-----------------------

    $ docker-compose build


Running the network
-------------------

    $ docker-compose scale statsmon=1 nodes=10

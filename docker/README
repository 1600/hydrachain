Running a local network with docker
===================================

Prerequisites
-------------

- docker
- docker-compose


Note: The following commands all have to be run from within the
docker/dev/hydrachain directory


Building the images
-------------------

    $ docker-compose build

This will take a while the first time you run this command since it downloads
and compiles all dependencies.

Subsequent runs will be significantly faster due to docker caching the build
steps.

Sometimes it may be necessary to temporarily disable this cache (e.g. when
you want to forcefully update the dependencies) this can be done with the
following command:

    $ docker-compose build --no-cache


Running the network
-------------------

    $ docker-compose scale statsmon=1 nodes=10

This will start 10 node and one status monitor containers.
The status monitor's web interface will be accessible on port 3000.



Stopping & removing the containers
----------------------------------

    $ docker-compose stop && docker-compose rm


To restart with new (hydrachain) code simply stop, rm and restart there is no need to
rebuild the images.

To update the dependencies you will however need to rebuild the image (see above).
